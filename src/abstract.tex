Multi-robot map building of unknown environments is a fundamental problem for multi-robot autonomous robotics. 
Different from single-robot's huge on-board communication bandwidth, the limited communication resources between robots becomes the bottleneck of the multi-robot map building.
In order to do multi-robot map building in communication constrained environments, this paper proposes a data-efficient map representation and merging method based on topology map, called PRET.
% (Place Representor Embedded Topology map)
PRET uses CNN to generate place representor of each new comming place and embeds the representor to the topology map.
Based on the representors, the topology maps of different robots can be easily shared and merged with little communication resources.
Compared with the tranditional grid map. The data transfer is reduced by ?\%. The navigation path is only ?\% higher than the grid map. %结果稍微丰富下
