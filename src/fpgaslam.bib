  abstract = {We present ORB-SLAM2, a complete simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system for monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, including map reuse, loop closing, and relocalization capabilities. The system works in real time on standard central processing units in a wide variety of environments from small hand-held indoors sequences, to drones flying in industrial environments and cars driving around a city. Our back-end, based on bundle adjustment with monocular and stereo observations, allows for accurate trajectory estimation with metric scale. Our system includes a lightweight localization mode that leverages visual odometry tracks for unmapped regions and matches with map points that allow for zero-drift localization. The evaluation on 29 popular public sequences shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, being in most cases the most accurate SLAM solution. We publish the source code, not only for the benefit of the SLAM community, but with the aim of being an out-of-the-box SLAM solution for researchers in other fields.},

  author = {Choudhary, Siddharth and Carlone, Luca and Nieto, Carlos and Rogers, John and Christensen, Henrik I and Dellaert, Frank}, 
  journal = {The International Journal of Robotics Research}, 
  abstract = {We consider the following problem: a team of robots is deployed in an unknown environment and it has to collaboratively build a map of the area without a reliable infrastructure for communication. The backbone for modern mapping techniques is pose graph optimization, which estimates the trajectory of the robots, from which the map can be easily built. The first contribution of this paper is a set of distributed algorithms for pose graph optimization: rather than sending all sensor data to a remote sensor fusion server, the robots exchange very partial and noisy information to reach an agreement on the pose graph configuration. Our approach can be considered as a distributed implementation of a two-stage approach that already exists, where we use the Successive Over-Relaxation and the Jacobi Over-Relaxation as workhorses to split the computation among the robots. We also provide conditions under which the proposed distributed protocols converge to the solution of the centralized two-stage approach. As a second contribution, we extend the proposed distributed algorithms to work with the object-based map models. The use of object-based models avoids the exchange of raw sensor measurements (e.g. point clouds or RGB-D data) further reducing the communication burden. Our third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed techniques, including tests in realistic Gazebo simulations and field experiments in a military test facility. Abundant experimental evidence suggests that one of the proposed algorithms (the Distributed Gauss–Seidel method) has excellent performance. The Distributed Gauss–Seidel method requires minimal information exchange, has an anytime flavor, scales well to large teams (we demonstrate mapping with a team of 50 robots), is robust to noise, and is easy to implement. Our field tests show that the combined use of our distributed algorithms and object-based models reduces the communication requirements by several orders of magnitude and enables distributed mapping with large teams of robots in real-world problems.

   Abstract = {We propose a non-iterative solution to the P n P problem—the estimation of the pose of a calibrated camera from n 3D-to-2D point correspondences—whose computational complexity grows linearly with n . This is in contrast to state-of-the-art methods that are O ( n 5 ) or even O ( n 8 ), without being more accurate. Our method is applicable for all n ≥4 and handles properly both planar and non-planar configurations. Our central idea is to express the n 3D points as a weighted sum of four virtual control points. The problem then reduces to estimating the coordinates of these control points in the camera referential, which can be done in O ( n ) time by expressing these coordinates as weighted sum of the eigenvectors of a 12×12 matrix and solving a small constant number of quadratic equations to pick the right weights. Furthermore, if maximal precision is required, the output of the closed-form solution can be used to initialize a Gauss-Newton scheme, which improves accuracy with negligible amount of additional time. The advantages of our method are demonstrated by thorough testing on both synthetic and real-data.},

   Abstract = {In this work we scrutinize a low level computer vision task - non-maximum suppression (NMS) - which is a crucial preprocessing step in many computer vision applications. Especially in real time scenarios, efficient algorithms for such preprocessing algorithms, which operate on the full image resolution, are important. In the case of NMS, it seems that merely the straightforward implementation or slight improvements are known. We show that these are far from being optimal, and derive several algorithms ranging from easy-to-implement to highly-efficient},
